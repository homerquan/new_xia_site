abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as a new wireless communication
  technology with appealing benefits not present in radio communication. However,
  current VLC designs commonly require LED lights to emit perceptible light beams,
  which greatly limits the applicable scenarios of VLC (e.g., in a sunny day when
  indoor lighting is not needed), and brings high energy overhead and unpleasant visual
  experiences for mobile devices to transmit data using VLC. We design and develop
  DarkLight, a new VLC primitive that allows light-based communication to be sustained
  even when LEDs emit extremely-low luminance. The key idea is to encode data into
  ultra-short, imperceptible light pulses. We tackle challenges in circuit designs,
  data encoding/decoding schemes, and DarkLight networking, to efficiently generate
  and reliably detect ultra-short light pulses using off-the-shelf, low-cost LEDs
  and photodiodes. Our DarkLight prototype supports 1.3-m distance with 1.6-Kbps data
  rate. By loosening up VLC's reliance on visible light beams, DarkLight presents
  an unconventional direction of VLC and fundamentally broadens VLC's application
  scenarios.
