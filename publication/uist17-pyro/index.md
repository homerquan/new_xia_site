abstract: We present Pyro, a micro thumb-tip gesture recognition technique based on
  thermal infrared signals radiating from the fingers. Pyro uses a compact, low-power
  passive sensor, making it suitable for wearable and mobile applications. To demonstrate
  the feasibility of Pyro, we developed a self-contained prototype consisting of the
  infrared pyroelectric sensor, a custom sensing circuit, and software for signal
  processing and machine learning. A ten-participant user study yielded a 93.9% cross-validation
  accuracy and 84.9% leave-one-session-out accuracy on six thumb-tip gestures. Subsequent
  lab studies demonstrated Pyro's robustness to varying light conditions, hand temperatures,
  and background motion. We conclude by discussing the insights we gained from this
  work and future research questions.
