abstract: Visual tags (e.g.,barcodes, QR codes) are ubiquitous in modern day life,
  though they rely on obtrusive geometric patterns to encode data, degrading the overall
  user experience. We propose a new paradigm of passive visual tags which utilizes
  light polarization to imperceptibly encode data using cheap, widely-available components.
  The tag and its data can be extracted from background scenery using off-the-shelf
  cameras with inexpensive LCD shutters attached atop camera lenses. We examine the
  feasibility of this design with real-world experiments. Initial results show zero
  bit errors at distances up to 3.0~m, an angular-detection range of 110'', and robustness
  to manifold ambient light and occlusion scenarios.
