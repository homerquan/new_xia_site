abstract: Much of the stress and strain of student life remains hidden. The StudentLife
  continuous sensing app assesses the day-to-day and week-by-week impact of workload
  on stress, sleep, activity, mood, sociability, mental well-being and academic performance
  of a single class of 48 students across a 10 week term at Dartmouth College using
  Android phones. Results from the StudentLife study show a number of significant
  correlations between the automatic objective sensor data from smartphones and mental
  health and educational outcomes of the student body. We also identify a Dartmouth
  term lifecycle in the data that shows students start the term with high positive
  affect and conversation levels, low stress, and healthy sleep and daily activity
  patterns. As the term progresses and the workload increases, stress appreciably
  rises while positive affect, sleep, conversation and activity drops off. The StudentLife
  dataset is publicly available on the web.
