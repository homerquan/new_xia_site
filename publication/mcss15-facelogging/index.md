abstract: We discuss the opportunistic face logging project that collected 5811 opportunistic
  photos using the front-facing camera from the smartphones of 37 participants over
  a 10-week period. We present our experiences using computer vision and human labeling
  approaches on the photos to assess mental health of the participants. Finally, we
  discuss our insights, challenges, and future directions.
