abstract: The ability to communicate and sense across the air- water boundary is essential
  for efficient exploration and monitoring of the underwater world. Existing wireless
  solutions for communication and sensing typically focus on a single physical medium
  and fall short in achieving high-bandwidth communication and accurate sensing across
  the air-water interface without any relays on the water surface. We study the use
  of laser light in this context given its ability to effectively pass the air-water
  boundary. We present a holistic system framework to address practical challenges
  such as ambient light interference and environmental dynamics. The proposed AmphiLight
  framework achieves 5 Mbps bi-directional throughput and zero bit error rate with
  ranges up to 6.1 m in strong ambient light conditions, and connection time improvements
  between 47.1% and 29.5% during wave dynamics. Our ongoing effort extends to realizing
  robust air-water sensing that enables aerial drones to track multiple underwater
  robots for topology planning and coordination.
