abstract: "We propose a compact noninvasive glucose monitoring system using polarized\
  \ light, where a user simply needs to place her palm on the device for measuring\
  \ her current glucose concentration level. The primary innovation of our system\
  \ is the ability to minimize light scattering from the skin and extract weak changes\
  \ in light polarization to estimate glucose concentration, all using low-cost hardware.\
  \ Our system exploits multiple wavelengths and light intensity levels to mitigate\
  \ the effect of user diversity and confounding factors (e.g., collagen and elastin\
  \ in the dermis). It then infers glucose concentration using a generic learning\
  \ model, thus no additional calibration is needed. We design and fabricate a compact\
  \ (17 cm \xD7 10 cm \xD7 5 cm) and low-cost (i.e., <$250) prototype using off-the-shelf\
  \ hardware. We evaluate our system with 41 diabetic patients and 9 healthy participants.\
  \ In comparison to a continuous glucose monitor approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration\
  \ (FDA), 89% of our results are within zone A (clinically accurate) of the Clarke\
  \ Error Grid. The absolute relative difference (ARD) is 10% . The r and p values\
  \ of the Pearson correlation coefficients between our predicted glucose concentration\
  \ and reference glucose concentration are 0.91 and 1.6 \xD7 10\u2212143, respectively.\
  \ These errors are comparable with FDA-approved glucose sensors, which achieve \u2248\
  90% clinical accuracy with a 10% mean ARD."
