abstract: Today's network control and management traffic are limited by their reliance
  on existing data networks. Fate sharing in this context is highly undesirable, since
  control traffic has very different availability and traffic delivery requirements.
  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of building a dedicated wireless facilities
  network for data centers. We propose Angora, a low-latency facilities network using
  low-cost, 60GHz beamforming radios that provides robust paths decoupled from the
  wired network, and flexibility to adapt to workloads and network dynamics. We describe
  our solutions to address challenges in link coordination, link interference and
  network failures. Our testbed measurements and simulation results show that Angora
  enables large number of low-latency control paths to run concurrently, while providing
  low latency end-to-end message delivery with high tolerance for radio and rack failures.
