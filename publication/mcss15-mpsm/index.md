abstract: Stress is an important aspect of human psychology. Many measures of stress
  have been developed over the years, but different issues exist for most of these
  measures. This study introduces the Mobile Photographic Stress Meter (MPSM), a new
  way to measure stress in which a user simply selects an image that best captures
  his or her stress level. Such a tool allows researchers to quickly measure stress
  in real time and in natural environments less onerous for the user. Our results
  show that MPSM is a valid measure of stress. Users find it easy and actually enjoyable
  to use. Our results also show that MPSM is strongly correlated with the Perceived
  Stress Scale, a validated multi-item stress scale. The correlation has an r-value
  of 0.5559 and a p-value of less than 0.001. We conclude that MPSM can be applied
  effectively in research experiments and advance the research on stress.
