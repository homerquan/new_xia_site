abstract: The presence of semantic information in multivariate patterns of neural
  activity has been explored as a method of measuring knowledge and learning. Using
  fMRI, we investigated whether novice learners of American Sign Language (ASL) showed
  overlapping representations of semantic categories for words presented in a well-known
  (English) or newly learned (ASL) language. We find evidence of neural patterns that
  were partially shared between sign and speech in novice participants. This result
  provides evidence for the influence of even brief learning on neural representations
  in cross-modality language processing.
