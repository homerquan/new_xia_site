abstract: "We present StarLight, an infrastructure-based sensing system that reuses\
  \ light emitted from ceiling LED panels to reconstruct fine-grained user skeleton\
  \ postures continuously in real time. It relies on only a few (e.g., 20) photodiodes\
  \ placed at optimized locations to passively capture low-level visual clues (light\
  \ blockage information), with neither cameras capturing sensitive images, nor on-body\
  \ devices, nor electromagnetic interference. It then aggregates the blockage information\
  \ of a large number of light rays from LED panels and identifies best-fit 3D skeleton\
  \ postures. StarLight greatly advances the prior light-based sensing design by dramatically\
  \ reducing the number of intrusive sensors, overcoming furniture blockage, and supporting\
  \ user mobility. We build and deploy StarLight in a 3.6 m x 4.8 m office room, with\
  \ customized 20 LED panels and 20 photodiodes. Experiments show that StarLight achieves\
  \ 13.6\xB0 mean angular error for five body joints and reconstructs a mobile skeleton\
  \ at a high frame rate (40 FPS). StarLight enables a new unobtrusive sensing paradigm\
  \ to augment today\u2019s mobile sensing for continuous and accurate behavioral\
  \ monitoring."
