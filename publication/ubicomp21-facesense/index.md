abstract: "Face touch is an unconscious human habit. Frequent touching of sensitive/mucosal\
  \ facial zones (eyes, nose, and mouth)increases health risks by passing pathogens\
  \ into the body and spreading diseases. Furthermore, accurate monitoring of face\
  \ touch is critical for behavioral intervention. Existing monitoring systems only\
  \ capture objects approaching the face, rather than detecting actual touches. As\
  \ such, these systems are prone to false positives upon hand or object movement\
  \ in proximity to one\u2019s face (e.g., picking up a phone). We present FaceSense,\
  \ an ear-worn system capable of identifying actual touches and differentiating them\
  \ between sensitive/mucosal areas from other facial areas. Following a multimodal\
  \ approach, FaceSenseintegrates low-resolution thermal images and physiological\
  \ signals. Thermal sensors sense the thermal infrared signal emitted by an approaching\
  \ hand, while physiological sensors monitor impedance changes caused by skin deformation\
  \ during a touch.Processed thermal and physiological signals are fed into a deep\
  \ learning model (TouchNet) to detect touches and identify the facial zone of the\
  \ touch. We fabricated prototypes using off-the-shelf hardware and conducted experiments\
  \ with 14 participants while they perform various daily activities (e.g., drinking,\
  \ talking). Results show a macro-F1-score of 83.4% for touch detection with leave-one-user-out\
  \ cross-validation and a macro-F1-score of 90.1% for touch zone identification with\
  \ a personalized model"
