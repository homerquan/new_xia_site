abstract: "Today, most spectrum allocation algorithms use conflict graphs to capture\
  \ interference conditions. The use of conflict graphs, however, is often questioned\
  \ by the wireless community for two reasons. First, building accurate conflict graphs\
  \ requires significant overhead, and hence does not scale to outdoor networks. Second,\
  \ conflict graphs cannot properly capture accumulative interference. In this paper,\
  \ we use large-scale measurement data as ground truth to understand how severe these\
  \ problems are and whether they can be overcome. We build \u201Cpractical\u201D\
  \ conflict graphs using measurement-calibrated propagation models, which remove\
  \ the need for exhaustive signal measurements by interpolating signal strengths\
  \ using calibrated models. Calibrated models are imperfect, and we study the impact\
  \ of their errors on multiple steps in the process, from calibrating propagation\
  \ models, predicting signal strengths, to building conflict graphs. At each step,\
  \ we analyze the introduction, propagation, and final impact of errors by comparing\
  \ each intermediate result to its ground-truth counterpart. Our work produces several\
  \ findings. Calibrated propagation models generate location-dependent prediction\
  \ errors, ultimately producing conservative conflict graphs. While these \u201C\
  estimated conflict graphs\u201D lower spectrum utilization, their conservative nature\
  \ improves reliability by reducing the impact of accumulative interference. Finally,\
  \ we propose a graph augmentation technique to address remaining accumulative interference."
