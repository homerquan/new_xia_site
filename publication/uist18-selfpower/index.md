abstract: "We present a self-powered module for gesture recognition that utilizes\
  \ small, low-cost photodiodes for both energy harvesting and gesture sensing. Operating\
  \ in the photovoltaic mode, photodiodes harvest energy from ambient light. In the\
  \ meantime, the instantaneously harvested power from individual photodiodes is monitored\
  \ and exploited as clues for sensing finger gestures in proximity. Harvested power\
  \ from all photodiodes are aggregated to drive the whole gesture-recognition module\
  \ including the micro-controller running the recognition algorithm. We design robust,\
  \ lightweight algorithm to recognize finger gestures in the presence of ambient\
  \ light fluctuations. We fabricate two prototypes to facilitate user's interaction\
  \ with smart glasses and smart watch. Results show 99.7%/98.3% overall precision/recall\
  \ in recognizing five gestures on glasses and 99.2%/97.5% precision/recall in recognizing\
  \ seven gestures on the watch. The system consumes 34.6 \xB5W/74.3 \xB5W for the\
  \ glasses/watch and thus can be powered by the energy harvested from ambient light.\
  \ We also test system's robustness under varying light intensities, light directions,\
  \ and ambient light fluctuations, where the system maintains high recognition accuracy\
  \ (> 96%) in all tested settings."
