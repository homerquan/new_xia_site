abstract: "The proxemics of social interactions (e.g., body distance, relative orientation)\
  \ influences many aspects of our everyday life: from patients' reactions to interaction\
  \ with physicians, successes in job interviews, to effective teamwork. Traditionally,\
  \ interaction proxemics has been studied via questionnaires and participant observations,\
  \ imposing high burden on users, low scalability and precision, and often biases.\n\
  In this paper we present Protractor, a novel wearable technology for measuring interaction\
  \ proxemics as part of non-verbal behavior cues with fine granularity. Protractor\
  \ employs near-infrared light to monitor both the distance and relative body orientation\
  \ of interacting users. We leverage the characteristics of near-infrared light (i.e.,\
  \ line-of-sight propagation) to accurately and reliably identify interactions; a\
  \ pair of collocated photodiodes aid the inference of relative interaction angle\
  \ and distance. We achieve robustness against temporary blockage of the light channel\
  \ (e.g., by the user's hand or clothes) by designing sensor fusion algorithms that\
  \ exploit inertial sensors to obviate the absence of light tracking results.\nWe\
  \ fabricated Protractor tags and conducted real-world experiments. Results show\
  \ its accuracy in tracking body distances and relative angles. The framework achieves\
  \ less than 6\xB0 error 95% of the time for measuring relative body orientation\
  \ and 2.3-cm - 4.9-cm mean error in estimating interaction distance. We deployed\
  \ Protractor tags to track user's non-verbal behaviors when conducting collaborative\
  \ group tasks. Results with 64 participants show that distance and angle data from\
  \ Protractor tags can help assess individual's task role with 84.9% accuracy, and\
  \ identify task timeline with 93.2% accuracy."
