abstract: "Accurate and continuous monitoring of joint rotational motion is crucial\
  \ for a wide range of applications such as physical rehabilitation [6, 85] and motion\
  \ training [22, 54, 68]. Existing motion capture systems, however, either need instrumentation\
  \ of the environment, or fail to track arbitrary joint motion, or impose wearing\
  \ discomfort by requiring rigid electrical sensors right around the joint area.\
  \ This work studies the use of everyday fabrics as a flexible and soft sensing medium\
  \ to monitor joint angular motion accurately and reliably. Specifically we focus\
  \ on the primary use of conductive stretchable fabrics to sense the skin deformation\
  \ during joint motion and infer the joint rotational angle. We tackle challenges\
  \ of fabric sensing originated by the inherent properties of elastic materials by\
  \ leveraging two types of sensing fabric and characterizing their properties based\
  \ on models in material science. We apply models from bio-mechanics to infer joint\
  \ angles and propose the use of dual strain sensing to enhance sensing robustness\
  \ against user diversity and fabric position offsets. We fabricate prototypes using\
  \ off-the-shelf fabrics and micro-controller. Experiments with ten participants\
  \ show 9.69\xB0 median angular error in tracking joint angle and its sensing robustness\
  \ across various users and activities."
