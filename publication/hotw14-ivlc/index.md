abstract: We propose for the first time an integrated Visible Light Communication
  (iVLC) system, which combines scalable VLC networking and accurate VLC sensing of
  mobile users. To meet this goal, we envision using modulated LED lights for communications
  between networked devices, while at the same time using the very same lights to
  accurately identify and track users, and importantly, sense and infer their gestures
  (e.g., pointing to an object in the room) as a means of collecting user analytics
  and enabling interactions with objects in smart spaces. Enabling the iVLC vision
  requires reliable VLC networking and robust VLC sensing. We discuss the key research
  components and open challenges in realizing this vision. By combining VLC networking
  and sensing, iVLC opens the way for a new class of context-aware applications and
  a new HCI paradigm not possible before.
