abstract: "In this paper we describe and characterize the largest Wi-Fi network trace\
  \ ever published: spanning seven years, approximately 3000 distinct access points,\
  \ 40,000 authenticated users, and 600,000 distinct Wi-Fi stations. The 7TB of raw\
  \ data are pre-processed into connection sessions, which are made available for\
  \ the research community. We describe the methods used to capture and process the\
  \ traces, and characterize the most prominent trends and changes during the seven-year\
  \ span of the trace. Furthermore, this Wi-Fi network covers the campus of Dartmouth\
  \ College, the same campus detailed a decade earlier in seminal papers about that\
  \ network and its users\u2019 network behavior. We thus are able to comment on changes\
  \ in patterns of usage, connection, and mobility in Wi-Fi deployments."
