abstract: 'Wireless signals and networks are ubiquitous. Though more reliable than
  ever, wireless networks still struggle with weak coverage, blind spots, and interference.
  Having a strong understanding of wireless signal propagation is essential for increasing
  coverage, optimizing performance, and minimizing interference for wireless networks.
  Extensive studies have analyzed the propagation of wireless signals and proposed
  theoretical models to simulate wireless signal propagation. Unfortunately, models
  of signal propagation are often not accurate in reality. Real-world signal measurements
  are required for validation.

  Existing methods for collecting wireless measurements either involve researchers
  walking to each location of interest and manually collecting measurements, or place
  sensors at each measurement location. As such, they require large amounts of time
  and effort and can be costly. We propose DroneSense, a system for measuring wireless
  signals in the 3D space using autonomous drones. Drone-Sense reduces the time and
  effort required for measurement collection, and is affordable and accessible to
  all users. It provides researchers with an efficient method to quickly analyze wireless
  coverage and test their wireless propagation models.'
