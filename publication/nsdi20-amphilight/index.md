abstract: Air-water communication is fundamental for efficient underwater operations,
  such as environmental monitoring, surveying, or coordinating of heterogeneous aerial
  and underwater systems. Existing wireless techniques mostly focus on a single physical
  medium and fall short in achieving high-bandwidth bidirectional communication across
  the air-water interface. We propose a bidirectional, direct air-water wireless communication
  link based on laser light, capable of (1) adapting to water dynamics with ultrasonic
  sensing and (2) steering within a full 3D hemisphere using only a MEMS mirror and
  passive optical elements. In real-world experiments, our system achieves static
  throughputs up to 5.04 Mbps, zero-BER transmission ranges up to 6.1m in strong ambient
  light conditions, and connection time improvements between 47.1% and 29.5% during
  wave dynamics.
