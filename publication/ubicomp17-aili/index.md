abstract: "Free-hand gestural input is essential for emerging user interactions. We\
  \ present Aili, a table lamp reconstructing a 3D hand skeleton in real time, requiring\
  \ neither cameras nor on-body sensing devices. Aili consists of an LED panel in\
  \ a lampshade and a few low-cost photodiodes embedded in the lamp base. To reconstruct\
  \ a hand skeleton, Aili combines 2D binary blockage maps from vantage points of\
  \ different photodiodes, which describe whether a hand blocks light rays from individual\
  \ LEDs to all photodiodes. Empowering a table lamp with sensing capability, Aili\
  \ can be seamlessly integrated into the existing environment. Relying on such low-level\
  \ cues, Aili entails lightweight computation and is inherently privacy-preserving.\
  \ We build and evaluate an Aili prototype. Results show that Aili\u2019s algorithm\
  \ reconstructs a hand pose within 7.2 ms on average, with 10.2\xB0 mean angular\
  \ deviation and 2.5-mm mean translation deviation in comparison to Leap Motion.\
  \ We also conduct user studies to examine the privacy issues of Leap Motion and\
  \ solicit feedback on Aili\u2019s privacy protection. We conclude by demonstrating\
  \ various interaction applications Aili enables."
