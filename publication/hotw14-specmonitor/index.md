abstract: 'We are facing an increasingly difficult challenge in spectrum management:
  how to perform real-time spectrum monitoring with strong coverage of deployed regions.
  Today''s spectrum measurements are carried out by government employees driving around
  with specialized hardware that is usually bulky and expensive, making the task of
  gathering real-time, large-scale spectrum monitoring data extremely difficult and
  cost prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a solution to the spectrum monitoring
  problem by leveraging the power of the masses, i.e. millions of wireless users,
  using low-cost, commoditized spectrum monitoring hardware. We envision an ecosystem
  where crowdsourced smartphone users perform automated and continuous spectrum measurements
  using their mobile devices, and report the results to a monitoring agency in real-time.
  We perform an initial feasibility study to verify the efficacy of our mobile monitoring
  platform compared to that of conventional monitoring devices like USRP GNU radios.
  Results indicate that commoditized real-time spectrum monitoring is indeed feasible
  in the near future. We conclude by presenting a set of open challenges and potential
  directions for follow-up research.'
